## Installation and Execution

## Description of the game

Blinq is a connection game for two players, where the main objective is to connect both sides of the player's color. To that, the game has dual coloured square blocks, that are the pieces used to connect the sides. This is a game where the players must be strategists, in order to complete their path, having in account questions like stacking and the other user thoughts.

There are some placement rules that must be considered:
    - Blocks must be parallel to the board lines
    - Blocks must be placed inside a cell
    - Blocks on top of other blocks must rest atop an arrangement of 2x2 blocks, and centred on it

The game ends in case of forfeit, or when a player connects, thw two sides of her colour. The game can also end in a draw in case of no more pieces left and connection is not completed.

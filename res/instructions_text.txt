Blinq is a connection game that uses dual coloured
square blocks composed of two rectangles and shared by both
players, wh


Players alternate turns placing those blocks according to some
simple stacking rules, each trying to connect the two sides of the
board of her colour.


Each player has an allocated colour (white or black). Each player
takes half of the blocks.

Starting with White, players alternate turns placing one of their
blocks on the board following these placement rules:
- The blocks must be placed with the sides parallel to the board
lines.
- When placed on the board, the block must be placed inside a cell.

When placed on top of other blocks it must rest atop an
arrangement of 2x2 blocks, and centred on it.



The game ends when one of the players resigns2 (losing the game)
or, at the end of her turn, one of the players has connected the two
sides of her colour (winning the game). The path connecting the
two sides of the board must be continuous along the surfaces of
the same colour when viewed from above.

If the players run out of pieces and a connection has not been
made, it is a draw.
